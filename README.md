# Glownet Interview App

Please fix and fulfill the application as follows:

``` 
View should inform to the activity:
  1. Show the event list after retrieving the list from the interactor.
  2. Show an error because there is no internet connection
  3. Show and hide loading circle element (progressBar)
  4. Show when an event has been clicked (toast)

When the view informs to the activity about 4, using renderer pedrovgs library,
you should add the clicking events to the adapter.

Probably we missed some view injection with butterknifeâ€¦

Implement the retrofit interface, fulfilling EventApi model and mapping it to Event entity 
following clean code patterns.
The JSON with the event list is already in the code. Adapt anything you need.
``` 
When you finish the exercise, please zip the project and sent to the email below. No pull requests, 
branches or forks given an obv concern of copycats :)

If you have any doubt please send an email to: arturo at glownet.com
